# RobotArm Python Code for Assignment 3
5.Write python functions that computes the spatial and body Jacobians as a function of robot joint angles.

6.Write python functions to determine manipulability measures u1, u2, and u3.

7.Are you able to identify some singular configurations? Can you verify singularity by inspection of the jacobian?

8.Suppose that you need the robot to hold an object of weight 150g. Write a python function that, given the configuration of the arm as an input (the joint angles), returns the neccessary torques to be applied to each joint motor in order to hold the object weight. Test your function with some example configurations and verify that result is correct.
